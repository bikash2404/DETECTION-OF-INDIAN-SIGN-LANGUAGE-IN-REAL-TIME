# Indian Sign Language Detection in Real Time

## Overview

The Indian Sign Language Detection project is a state-of-the-art machine learning application designed to recognize and translate Indian Sign Language (ISL) into text. Utilizing advanced computer vision and deep learning techniques, this project aims to bridge communication gaps for the hearing and speech impaired community.

## Features

- **Real-time Sign Language Recognition**: Recognizes ISL signs using a webcam in real-time.
- **Text-to-Speech Integration**: Converts recognized signs into audible speech.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides live feedback on recognized signs for ease of use.

## Technologies

- **OpenCV**: For real-time image processing and capturing.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For training and inference of the deep learning model.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and data manipulation.
- **Pillow**: For image processing tasks.
- **pyttsx3**: For text-to-speech functionality.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher.
- Basic knowledge of Python and command line operations.

### Setting Up

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bikash2404/DETECTION-OF-INDIAN-SIGN-LANGUAGE-IN-REAL-TIME.git
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (recommended)**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download Pre-trained Model (if applicable)**:
   Follow the instructions in `models/README.md` to download and place the pre-trained model files in the directory.
